# part_detection
Git repo for my internship project at INRAE in Montpellier, in collaboration with INRIA. Goal of the project is to build a part-based image classification model, that looks at small discriminative regions in an image for classification, instead of classifying based on the entire image.

Three datasets are required:

Whale dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/humpback-whale

CUB dataset:
